Practical Tutorials
###################

In this section, we will put what we have learnt so far about Bioflows into action. We are going to write real-world bioinformatics pipelines in BioFlows.
We will start from the easiest example and try to make it harder as we move along these tutorials. If the tutorial was written somewhere else, the original website will be acknowledged.
